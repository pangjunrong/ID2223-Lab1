The completed Task 1 can be found in the "./Task-1" folder, while Task 2 is found in "./Task-2". In both cases, the virtual environment is shared and can be shared. You can initialize a virtual environment in the root folder of this project based on the requirements.txt provided.

For Task 2, the wine-batch-inference-pipeline included a subset of the entire wine quality range so as to reduce the number of runs needed to create the confusion matrix assuming a normal distribution. Furthermore, the wine-quality-pipeline-daily used for wine generation is simulated based on the a small subset of the EDA conducted to prove the code works.
